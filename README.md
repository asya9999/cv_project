# Chest X-Ray Pneumothorax images segmentation
> Computer vision and deep learning models can help hospital staff to detect such disease with high accuracy without direct attention of a doctor. Machine learning models can perform segmentation, which can highlight the presence of air in the pleural space from chest X-Ray pneumothorax images

We tried to apply transfer learning and train FCN based on different encoders:
- VGG19
- ResNet50
- InceptionV3

FCN with InceptionV3 works better than others
